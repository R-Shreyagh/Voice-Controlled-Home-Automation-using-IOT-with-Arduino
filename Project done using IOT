REAL PROJECT : VOICE CONTROLLED HOME AUTOMATION
Components Required:
1. Arduino UNO Board
2. HC-05 Bluetooth Module
3. Three LEDs (Red, Yellow & Green)
4. One 1K Ohm Resistors
5. One 2K Ohm Resistor.
6. Arduino USB Cable
7. Breadboard
8. Jumper Wires M-M.
Steps to Follow:
1. Connect -ve of Red LED on C9 & +ve on C10.
2. Connect -ve of Yellow LED on C14 & +ve on C15.
3. Connect -ve of Green LED on C19 & +ve on C20.
4. Connect a jumper wire between –ve Terminal of Bread Board (GND) & A9.
5. Connect a jumper wire between –ve Terminal of Bread Board (GND) & A14.
6. Connect a jumper wire between –ve Terminal of Bread Board (GND) & A19.
7. Connect a Jumper Wire from Arduino GND to Bread Board –ve (GND) Terminal
Strip.
8. Connect a jumper wire between Arduino PIN 13 & D10.
9. Connect a jumper wire between Arduino PIN 12 & D15.
10. Connect a jumper wire between Arduino PIN 11 & D20.
11. Please follow the same Steps from Step 3 to Step 10 of Project 3- Reading
Enviornmental Values on Smarphone.
12. Open the Sketch for Voice-Activation-Arduino Program.
13. Connect the USB cable with Arduino & Computer.
14. Click on Upload Option to download the program in Arduino. Note: While
downloading the program please disconnect the Rx & Tx Jumper wire from
Arduino Board. Once you finish with the download then re connect the Rx & Tx
Jumper Wire.
15. Download the AMR_Voice App from Google Playstore in your Android
Smartphone.
16. Run the AMR_Voice App in your Android Smartphone.
17. App will ask you to enable the Bluetooth. Allow It.
18. Search for your Bluetooth Device HC-05-(Group No). Once Connected Red Led on
Bluetooth module will blink once per second instead of fast blinking.
19. Then control the devices from your Voice Commands on AMR_Voice App.
20. Voice Commands to be used: light on, light off, fan on, fan off, ac on, ac of,
everything on, everything of.
